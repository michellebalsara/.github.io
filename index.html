<h1>Wingstop: A Revelation</h1>
    <img src="images/wingstop-god.png" class="responsive" alt="Wingstop Image: A T-shirt reading that reads, I know God is real becase Wingstop exist">

 <p>Today I had a revelation. Some may call it a an epiphany but I call it FACTS. Wingstop is the supreme ruler of all the wing joints to exist around the world. Don’t think Houston, don’t think Texas,  don’t even think the United States: Think Global. Wingstop is the only wing joint you should ever dine at and here’s why. </p>
 <p>Think of the first time you ever bit into one of their garlic parmesan wings. Do you remember that crunch, that sizzle, that buttery goodness spread across your tongue? Do you remember the wonderful customer service and all the times an employee snuck an extra wing into your combo? Take a moment and just think about all the second-tier wing joints you’ve eaten at. </p>
 <ol> 
     <li> Does Buffalo Wild Wings drizzle mango habanero sauce on garlic parmesan wings if you want it? No.</li>
     <li> Does Wingz N More remember your name when you call for a pickup order? No. </li>
     <li> Does Pluckers have beautiful seasoned fries that melt in your mouth? No. They have Waffle fries and let me tell you, it is not brunch time. </li>
 </ol> 
 <p>So, the next time you think about going to eat at one of those sad wing establishments, you think very carefully and ask yourself… Am I being my best self today? Do I love myself? Do I want to treat my body like the temple it is by feeding it pure perfection? If you’ve answered yes to all of these, the right choice becomes clear. Ditch the B Team, join me on the A Team, and drive over to your local Wingstop. You will have no ragrets. Not even a single letter.</p>
